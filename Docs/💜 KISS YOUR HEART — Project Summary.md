# **💜 KISS YOUR HEART — Project Summary**

**Kiss Your Heart** (KYHeart) is a creative photography and flow-culture project based in Lisbon, founded by **Hope**, born in Lomé (Togo), raised in Munich, shaped by hotel management, hospitality, festivals, music, and a deep fascination for **Flow** — inspired by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, Taoist philosophy, Japan, and the freedom of One Piece.

Kiss Your Heart stands for **capturing the true essence of people, places, and communities** — the moment when someone enters **the Zone** and their inner flow becomes visible.

Through your Nikon camera, you freeze  
 **authenticity, passion, and movement**  
 in portraits, events, creative sessions, and artist collaborations.

Your project has three pillars:

### **1️⃣ Honouring Artists & Communities**

You spotlight underground creators, musicians, dancers, DJs, tattoo artists, and community spaces in Lisbon — like HempyRoots, Secret Garden LX, Outbreak Music — celebrating their culture and their contribution to the city’s creative pulse.

You document:

* artists in their natural flow

* portraits

* behind-the-scenes

* mini interviews / flow talks

* the vibe of local spaces that carry community energy (the 5 “seals” of hip-hop: people, places, culture, rhythm, expression).

### **2️⃣ Professional Photography Services**

You offer:

* portrait photography

* event coverage

* studio sessions (with partner studios)

* creative branding support (logo, philosophy, identity)

* special artist packages

Your motto:  
 **“Feel your flow — and let’s create.”**  
 You help artists, brands, and individuals express their uniqueness visually.

### **3️⃣ Flow Culture & Personal Philosophy**

Kiss Your Heart is a philosophy:

* follow your intrinsic will (the “D”)

* embrace community

* create without fear

* act with authenticity

* let your art breathe

It’s a blend of:

* Taoism

* Flow Psychology

* Pirate spirit (original Greek meaning: “one who tries, one who dares”)

* One Piece’s freedom culture

* Lisbon’s multicultural creative scene

Kiss Your Heart captures the true essence of people, places, and communities.  
 Through portrait, event, and artistic photography, the project focuses on the moment when someone enters *the Zone* — a state described by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi where creativity and self dissolve into pure expression.

Kiss Your Heart operates on three main pillars:

 KYHeart celebrates underground artists, musicians, DJs, dancers, tattoo artists, makers, and community spaces in Lisbon.  
 This includes places like HempyRoots, Secret Garden LX, Outbreak Music, and the Circle D Flow collective.

 Kiss Your Heart is more than visuals — it’s a philosophy rooted in intrinsic motivation, the “Will of D”, Taoism, and freedom of expression.  
 The project aims to build Circle D Flow, a dynamic creative spot that supports individuality, collaboration, and artistic growth.

**Mission:**  
 To create visual spaces where art feels free, people feel seen, and communities grow stronger.

**Vision:**

# **⭐ 2\) WEBSITE “ABOUT ME” PAGE — Ready to Copy**

**ABOUT ME — HOPE (KISS YOUR HEART)**

My name is Hope — born in Lomé, raised in Munich, now living and creating in Lisbon.  
 My journey began in hospitality, festivals, and nightlife culture. Working in hotels like Marriott and organizing experiences at Jazz Hotel Stuttgart taught me the power of presence, people, and connection.

Photography became the tool that let me translate what I feel:  
 **the moment a person enters the Zone** — where expression becomes effortless and truth becomes visible.

A year in Japan inspired me to study Taoism, Flow psychology, and the meaning of intrinsic will.  
 This is where the “D” in Circle D Flow was born — a symbol of the unbreakable, inner fire that guides us to act from the heart.

I founded **Kiss Your Heart** to capture those moments of raw authenticity:  
 artists in their element, communities in motion, spaces that breathe culture, and individuals discovering themselves.

I document Lisbon’s creative world — DJs, tattoo artists, dancers, collectives, local heroes — and support them with portrait sessions, event coverage, and brand creation.

I believe everyone carries a unique rhythm,  
 and my mission is to help you see it, feel it, and express it.

**Feel your flow — and let’s create.**
